# 🧠 Ad-Hoc Consumer Goods Insights 

Welcome to my SQL case study project, part of the **Codebasics Ad-Hoc SQL Challenge**. This project involves solving 10 real-world business requests for a consumer goods company using SQL. It highlights how data analysis can drive decisions in areas like product strategy, customer targeting, and sales performance.

## 🧍 Problem Statement

A leading consumer goods company wants to empower its leadership team with fast, data-driven decision-making. However, they lack a centralized reporting structure and rely heavily on the data team for insights.

The stakeholders of the company often come up with **ad-hoc questions** like:
- Which products are growing?
- Who are our top customers?
- Which sales channels perform best?
- Are we giving too many discounts?

As a Data Analyst, my job is to **analyze structured data using SQL** and deliver quick, accurate, and actionable insights to answer these spontaneous queries.

This project simulates **10 such ad-hoc business requests**, each answering a key business question using real data and SQL techniques.

## 🔍 Project Summary

In this challenge, I worked with various datasets to answer spontaneous business questions using SQL. The queries covered areas like sales trends, product growth, manufacturing costs, customer behavior, and performance by channel. Each SQL solution was designed to be efficient, readable, and ready for stakeholder interpretation.

## 🧬 SQL Concepts Used

This project demonstrates strong hands-on understanding of:

- ✅ `JOINs` – Inner, Left Joins to merge datasets  
- ✅ `GROUP BY` & `ORDER BY` – for aggregation and sorting  
- ✅ `CASE` statements – for custom logic (e.g., fiscal quarters)  
- ✅ `RANK()` & `DENSE_RANK()` – window functions for product ranking  
- ✅ `CTEs` (Common Table Expressions) – for readable step-by-step querying  
- ✅ `Subqueries` – for comparative and nested calculations  
- ✅ `DATE` functions – like `MONTH()`, `QUARTER()`, `YEAR()`  
- ✅ Aggregate functions – `SUM()`, `COUNT(DISTINCT)`, `AVG()`  
- ✅ `ROUND()` & `CONCAT()` – for formatting output
